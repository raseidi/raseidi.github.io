# Rafael Seidi Oyamada

Rafael is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Milan, in an industrial program attached to Avio s.p.a. company. He received his BSc and MSc degrees in 2019 and 2021, respectively, both in Computer Science at the Londrina State University. His current research interests lie primarily in process mining and deep learning. In particular, he works with generative models for enhancing business processes and encoding techniques for event data. Alternative interests include databases for similarity-based retrieval, graph algorithms, and meta-learning.
