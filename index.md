# Rafael Seidi Oyamada

Welcome! I am a Master's Student, currently based at the State University of Londrina, in Brazil. My research interests lie primarily in the automated configuration of proximity graphs, specifically for similarity-based retrieval systems. I am also highly interested in meta-learning, mainly for investigating meta-features involving dataset complexity.
