# Survey and Benchmark on Trace Encoding Methods

In order to guide researchers and practitioners to choose the right algorithm according to their goals, we proposed new evaluation metrics and performed an extensive experimental evaluation to serve as a benchmark.
The metrics cover what we believe is essential for encoding in PM: expressivity of the encoded data, scalability w.r.t. the event log cardinality, correlation between performances of the encoding algorithm performance and the PM task, and domain agnosticism regarding PM tasks.
The benchmark focuses on the anomaly detection task and assesses 27 encoding methods through hundreds of event logs. We discuss future directions based on our findings. Therefore, we also expect the proposals and insights presented in our work can be leveraged for other PM tasks.
