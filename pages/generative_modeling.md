Since I am mostly interested on generative modeling, in this page I provide some toy examples of what I work with. 

# Conditioned generation 

### Teaching generative adversarial networks how to generate even or odd numbers

In this project, I designed a conditioned GAN architecture that learns how to generate even or odd numbers from the mnist dataset. See an example in the figure below. [Repostiroy](https://github.com/raseidi/gans) for code.

### Conditioned decoding methods

Still in development.
